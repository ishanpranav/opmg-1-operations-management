## Question 1

> Suppose that the rate of customer demand for candy bars at Grocery City is
> constant at 200 candy bars per week. Each time that Grocery City places an
> order for more candy bars it must pay processing fees of $20 regardless of the
> size of the order. Holding costs for candy bars are $0.01 per candy bar per
> week. Finally, leadtime for the delivery of candy bars is 0 days. Assume that
> there are 52 weeks in a year.

### Question 1 Part A

> Suppose that Grocery City places an order for 500 candy bars each time that
> its inventory of candy bars reaches 50. Draw a graph showing the number of
> candy bars that Grocery City has on-hand in inventory at each point in time up
> until the time when it places its fourth order. Label the points in time at
> which Grocery City places a new order. What will be Grocery City’s average
> inventory holding costs per unit time? What will be Grocery City’s average
> fixed ordering costs per unit time? Assume that Grocery City starts out with
> 550 candy bars on day 0.

### Question 1 Part B

> Assuming that Grocery City would like to minimize the sum of its average
> purchasing, fixed ordering and holding costs per unit time, what is the
> optimal number of candy bars for Grocery City to purchase each time that it
> places an order and what should be its reorder point?

### Question 1 Part C

> Suppose now that it takes 1.5 weeks for each order of candy bars to be
> delivered. When the quantity of candy bars reaches what level should Grocery
> City place an order for more candy bars? Assume that Grocery City orders
> according to the optimal order quantity from part b above.

## Question 2

> Zara is determining how many coats to order for this upcoming winter selling
> season. Zara forecasts the demand distribution for coats this upcoming winter
> to be the following.

| Demand (number of coats) | Probability |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| 100 | 0.1 |
| 150 | 0.1 |
| 200 | 0.3 |
| 250 | 0.3 |
| 300 | 0.1 |
| 350 | 0.1 |

> Each coat costs Zara $50 to purchase wholesale and sells for $100 retail. At
> the end of the winter selling season, Zara may sell as many coats as it
> desires at a salvage value of $25 per coat.

### Question 2 Part A

> What is the optimal number of coats for Zara to purchase in order to maximize
> its average profit?

### Question 2 Part B

> Suppose that Zara has purchased 150 coats, what is the marginal value from a
> 151st coat? Is it profitable for Zara to purchase its 151st coat? Justify your
> answer.

### Question 3

> A pastry shop is considering how much hot chocolate to prepare each morning.
> Hot chocolate costs $0.30 per oz to make and sells for $0.60 per oz. Customers
> can buy hot chocolate in any number of ounces that they wish. Any hot
> chocolate not sold by the end of the day is discarded. The daily demand for
> hot chocolate is normally distributed with a mean of 2,000 oz and a standard
> deviation of 10 oz. How much hot chocolate should the pastry shop make each
> morning?
