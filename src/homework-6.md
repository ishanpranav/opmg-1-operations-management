## Question 1

> Pepperidge Farm is monitoring its process of making Goldfish. Every hour, they
> take a sample of 4 packets of Goldfish coming off of the production line and
> weigh each packet. The measurements taken from the first 10 samples are given
> below. All measurements are in ounces.

| Sample | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $\bar{x}$ | $R$ |
|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:---:|
| 1 | 10.18 | 9.72 | 9.66 | 10.24 | 9.95 | 0.58 |
| 2 | 10.30 | 9.64 | 10.07 | 9.57 | 9.90 | 0.73 |
| 3 | 10.18 | 9.89 | 9.96 | 9.51 | 9.89 | 0.67 |
| 4 | – | 10.03 | 9.74 | 9.55 | 9.91 | 0.75 |
| 5 | 10.28 | 9.97 | 9.75 | 9.70 | 9.93 | 0.58 |
| 6 | 9.98 | 10.00 | 9.76 | 9.96 | 9.93 | 0.24 |
| 7 | 9.80 | 9.93 | 9.88 | 9.74 | 9.84 | 0.19 |
| 8 | 9.69 | 10.00 | 10.11 | 10.26 | 10.02 | 0.57 |
| 9 | 9.93 | 9.53 | 10.06 | 9.60 | – | 0.53 |
| 10 | 10.15 | 9.66 | 9.70 | 10.27 | 9.95 | 0.61 |

### Question 1 Part A

> Calculate the upper and lower control limits for the $\bar{x}$-chart and the
> $R$-chart associated with this data. See below for the table of the $D_2$,
> $D_3$, and $D_4$ values.

| $n$ | $D_2$ | $D_3$ | $D_4$ |
|:---:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 2 | 1.128 | 0 | 3.267 |
| 3 | 1.693 | 0 | 2.575 |
| 4 | 2.059 | 0 | 2.282 |
| 5 | 2.326 | 0 | 2.116 |
| 6 | 2.534 | 0 | 2.004 |
| 10 | 3.078 | 0.233 | 1.777 |

### Question 1 Part B

> Plot the $\bar{x}$-chart and $R$-chart for Pepperidge Farm’s Goldfish
> production process. Also determine whether or not Pepperidge Farm’s process of
> making Goldfish is in control. If it is not in control, state what looks wrong
> on either the $\bar{x}$-chart or $R$-chart.

## Question 2

> Suppose that Samsung is testing its new phones to see if they are defective or
> not and to determine if its smartphone production process is in control or
> not. Every hour, Samsung samples 20 phones coming off of its production line
> and obtains the following results.

| Sample | Sample size | Number defective |
|:------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|
| 1 | 20 | 1 |
| 2 | 20 | 6 |
| 3 | 20 | 8 |
| 4 | 20 | 3 |
| 5 | 20 | 5 |
| 6 | 20 | 14 |
| 7 | 20 | 7 |
| 8 | 20 | 18 |
| 9 | 20 | 4 |
| 10 | 20 | 6 |

### Question 2 Part A

> Calculate the upper and lower control limits for the $P$-chart associated with
> the above data. Use a $z$-value of $3$ in determining your control limits.

### Question 2 Part B

> Determine whether or not the smartphone production process is in control. If
> it is not in control, state what looks wrong on the $P$-chart.

## Question 3

> Suppose that we are making an auto part and that the mean length of the part
> is $5\text{ in}$ with variance of $0.28\text{ in}^2$. We would like to set the
> upper and lower specification limits so that $99.90\%$ of all these auto parts
> fall within the upper and lower specification limits. Moreover, we would like
> the mean auto part width to be centered halfway between the upper and lower
> specification limits.

### Question 3 Part A

> What should we set the upper and lower specification limits to be?

Assume that the length of the auto part is normally distributed.

### Question 3 Part B

> Calculate $C_p$ and $C_{pk}$ for the process.
